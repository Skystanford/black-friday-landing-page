In the hero section, the sale is emphasized in a bright red font. Below are action buttons for “Shop Now” and “Get Discount Code”. The “Shop Now” button will navigate users to the store’s catalogue while the “Get Discount Code” button generates a discount code for the user. This is to encourage users to use the discount code in their shopping.
Below the hero section, New and Hot Products are displayed that Poppy’s wishes to sell during the sale. Each product card emphasizes the discount percentage, the discounted price and the “Add to Cart” action button. The sizes of the sweaters have been conveniently placed in the product card to keep visitors from constantly switching between pages.
The header section also provides details regarding delivery and is coloured orange to draw the user’s attention to the important message. The message states: “Due to high volume of orders, orders may be delayed. We and our delivery team will work hard to ensure you receive you items as soon as possible.”
The Poppy’s Black Friday landing page is optimized for mobile view since majority of user’s access the website via a mobile device. In the mobile view, the navigation bar has been compressed into a hamburger menu to fit the smaller screen size of a mobile phone.
